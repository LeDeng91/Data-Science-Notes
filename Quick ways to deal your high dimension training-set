sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD:       This transformer performs linear dimensionality reduction by means of truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). Contrary to PCA, 
                                          this estimator does not center the data before computing the singular value decomposition. 
                                          This means it can work with sparse matrices efficiently.
                                          
sklearn.decomposition.PCA:                Linear dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition of the data to project it to a lower dimensional space. The input data 
                                          is centered but not scaled for each feature before applying the SVD.
                                          
sklearn.decomposition.FastICA:            A fast algorithm for Independent Component Analysis     

sklearn.random_projection.GaussianRandomProjection:           Reduce dimensionality through Gaussian random projection. The components of the random matrix 
                                                              are drawn from N(0, 1 / n_components).
                                                             
sklearn.random_projection.SparseRandomProjection:             Reduce dimensionality through sparse random projection

sklearn.random_projection.SparseRandomProjection:             Sparse random matrix is an alternative to dense random projection matrix that guarantees similar embedding quality 
                                                              while being much more memory efficient and allowing faster computation of the projected data.
