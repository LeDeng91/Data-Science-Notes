%matplotlib notebook        #This command provides an interactive environment for the user of jupyter notebook. 
                              For programming in other environments don't forget to use plt.show() to show the graphic.

plt.plot()                  #Very basic command. Draw a graphic! Always in this format: plt.plot(x,y)
