-----------------------------------------------------------------What to do if the accuracy of a NN is low--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Try different optimizers, based on my experience Adam is a good starting point.
Try different activation functions; I recommend you to start with "relu", and try "selu" and "elu" as well.
Add regularization. Dropout and BatchNormalization may increase your test accuracy.
Give your network some time, train it longer.
Play around with hyperparameters such as a number of layers, batch size, a number of epochs, learning rate and so on...
Lastly, always normalize your data before feeding it to the NN
